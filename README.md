# About
This repository contains all my labwork & projects from UIUC's [STAT 107 Data Science DISCOVERY](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/) course. This is a fully updated back-up repository to save my own work. 

All work is completed using **Python Pandas, Python Libraries, & Jupyter Notebook**.

## PROJECTS (1-2 weeks)

### 1. [Project Mosaic](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/tree/main/project_mosaic)
Detailed spec: https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/guides/project-mosaic/

Summary: Re-creates a larger base image as a mosaic of smaller images, or "tiles". I retrieved over 500 tiles from NASA's Instagram Page (cannot be uploaded to GitHub as the file is too large) to create my "base image", which is my original photograph of a street at UIUC. 

### 2. [Project Cameras: Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/tree/main/project2)
Detailed spec: https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/guides/Course-Projects/You-and-Data-Science-Part-1/ 

"Camera" dataset chosen out of my passion for photographpy, and the nerd side of me that likes knowing the technicalities behind my cameras. 

Summary: Used Kaggle's "Camera" dataset to develop datasetes and visualizations and conduct a hypothesis test. This information was used to narrow down which camera models are best for purchase when the following factors are valued: resolution, release date, storage included, price, and effective pixels. The information was also used to determine which factors greatly impact price versus which factors don't.

 ## LABS (4 days)

 Lab Highlights: #8-10. 

 ### 1. [Lab Intro](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_intro/lab_intro.ipynb)
 
 Set up computer environment

 ### 2. [Lab Pandas](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_pandas/lab_pandas.ipynb)
 
 Basic practice and gaining familiarity the Pandas library. Imported datasets and created filtered subsets.

 ### 3. [Lab Experimental Design](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_exp_design/lab_exp_design.ipynb)

 Using Pandas to design an experiment, including creating treatment and control groups from datasets. 

 ### 4. [Lab Simpsons Paradox](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_simpsons_paradox/lab_simpsons_paradox.ipynb)

Determining if there's Simpson's Paradox in a dataset about party size, and a dataset about GPA. Includes practicing conditionals with Pandas dataframes.

 ### 5. [Lab Plots](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_plots/lab_plots.ipynb)

Working with MatPlotLib library to generate data visualizations of datasets. Used a university staff/salary dataset. 

 ### 6. [Lab GPA](https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/48517/assignments/1033059)

Calculating basic descriptive statistics from a dataset using Pandas, and generating data visualizations of said stats. Used grouping & aggregation. 
  
 ### 7. [Lab Favorites](https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/48517/assignments/1033060)

Practice using Random. Calculated probabilities. Practice with RGB values to determine which pixels in a dataset are primarly red, green, and blue -- in preparation for Project Mosaic. 

 ### 8. [Lab Similarity](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_similarity/lab_similarity.ipynb)

Use Pandas to determine which student is most similar to you in the STAT 107 course, using the "Hello Dataset." The Hello Dataset comprises of survey answers of 1000+ students in this course. Survey questions were simple and qualitative, including "What is your favorite color?", "Do you have a pet?", and "Favorite way to spend your free time?" 

Practice using the similarity function. Can only use about 2-4 questions to narrow down who your "twin" is. 

 ### 9. [Lab Justice](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_justice/lab_justice.ipynb)

Applying data science to **equity and social justice**. Determined how likely it was for the jury of Berghuis v Smith to be an all-White jury given that the population at the time of the trial was about 8% Black, and whether that was fair. Out of 100 randomly selected people, only 3 were Black, and none made it to the final 37 that were at the trial. Was the difference between this 8% and 3% significant and reflects an attempt to be exlusive, or due to chance? 

Topics: simulations, observed & expected values, functions, data visualizations, probability, sampling.

 ### 10. [Lab Probability](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_probability/lab_probability.ipynb)

 Working with the classic Birthday Probability problem. Determining how likely it is for at least two people to match birthdays in a room of n people, and how big n should be. 

 Used probability and data visualizations. 

 ### 11. [Lab Random Variable](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_random_variable/lab_random_variable.ipynb) 

Using custom discrete distributions and binomial distributions to model complex events, such as the minimum number of customers you need to break even in a day at your business. 

 ### 12. [Lab Populations](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_populations/lab_populations.ipynb)

 Using sampling and inference (confidence intervals, margin of error) to determine which UIUC students in the course follow UIUC's data science Instagram account, and which students would likely approve of a new school mascot. 
 
 ### 13. [Lab Hypothesis Tests](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_hypothesis_tests/lab_hypothesis_tests.ipynb)

 Use the HELLO dataset (defined in summary for lab #8) to conduct hypothesis tests that answer this question: "Do UIUC students get significantly different sleep compared to the average American?"

 ### 14. [Lab Regression](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_regression/lab_regression.ipynb)

 Made predictions of house prices with machine learning and linear regression. Used Seaborn package.
