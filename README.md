# About
This repository contains all my labwork & projects from UIUC's [STAT 107 Data Science DISCOVERY](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/) course. This is a fully updated back-up repository to save my own work. 

All work is completed using **Python Pandas & Jupyter Notebook**.

## PROJECTS (1-2 weeks)

### 1. [Project Mosaic](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/tree/main/project_mosaic)
Detailed spec: https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/guides/project-mosaic/

Summary: Re-creates a larger base image as a mosaic of smaller images, or "tiles". I retrieved over 500 tiles from NASA's Instagram Page (cannot be uploaded to GitHub as the file is too large) to create my "base image", which is my original photograph of a street at UIUC. 

### 2. Project Cameras: Hypothesis Testing
Detailed spec: https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/guides/Course-Projects/You-and-Data-Science-Part-1/ 

"Camera" dataset chosen out of my passion for photographpy, and the nerd side of me that likes knowing the technicalities behind my cameras. 

Summary: Used Kaggle's "Camera" dataset to develop datasetes and visualizations and conduct a hypothesis test. This information was used to narrow down which camera models are best for purchase when the following factors are valued: resolution, release date, storage included, price, and effective pixels. The information was also used to determine which factors greatly impact price versus which factors don't.

 Set up computer environment

 ### 2. [Lab Pandas](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_pandas/lab_pandas.ipynb)
 
 Basic practice and gaining familiarity the Pandas library. Imported datasets and created filtered subsets.

 ### 3. [Lab Experimental Design](https://github.com/rkwreck/STAT107_Labs_and_Projects/blob/main/lab_exp_design/lab_exp_design.ipynb)
