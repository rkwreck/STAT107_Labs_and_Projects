# About
This repository contains all my labwork & projects from UIUC's STAT 107 Data Science DISCOVERY course. This is a fully updated back-up repository to save my own work. 

All work is completed using **Python Pandas & Jupyter Notebook**.

## PROJECTS (1-2 weeks)

### Project Mosaic
Detailed spec: https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/guides/project-mosaic/

Summary: Re-creates a larger base image as a mosaic of smaller images, or "tiles". I retrieved over 500 tiles from NASA's Instagram Page (cannot be uploaded to GitHub as the file is too large). 

### Project Cameras: Hypothesis Testing
Detailed spec: https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/guides/Course-Projects/You-and-Data-Science-Part-1/ 

"Camera" dataset chosen out of my passion for photographpy, and the nerd side of me that likes knowing the technicalities behind my cameras. 

Summary: Used Kaggle's "Camera" dataset to develop datasetes and visualizations and conduct a hypothesis test. This information was used to narrow down which camera models are best for purchase when the following factors are valued: resolution, release date, storage included, price, and effective pixels. The information was also used to determine which factors greatly impact price versus which factors don't.
