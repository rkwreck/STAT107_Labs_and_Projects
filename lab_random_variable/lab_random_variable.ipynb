    "# Lab: Random Variable 💯\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and data science, random variables are used to model events that have uncertain outcomes.  For example, in DISCOVERY, we explore the **binomial distribution** to model flipping a coin, drawing from a deck of cards, guessing on a multiple choice exam, and many other events with a single, fixed probability of success.  However, what if there are multiple different outcomes?  This lab will explore creating custom discrete distributions in Python to model complex events!\n",
